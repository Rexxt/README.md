# Mizu
hello there

I'm a French tetris player, dev, designer and ***gamer***.
Preferred pronouns? Any/any, with preference for they/he in that order. 
On my way to become a 20G Master!

Enough of that. Now, Github stuff.
Projects I maintain:
* [Cambridge](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge)
* [Tetra Legends Plus](https://github.com/Rexxt/tetralegendsplus)
* [EBG Nightfox](https://github.com/Rexxt/example-block-game)

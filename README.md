# Mizu
hello there!<br>

I'm a French tetris player, dev, designer, sporadic streamer/music producer and gamer.<br>
Preferred pronouns? they/them (see [here](https://en.pronouns.page/@MizuOfficial))<br>
<br>
Enough of that. Now, Github stuff.<br>
Projects I maintain:
* [Cambridge](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge) (tetro has made nice stuff on their fork, we'll see what we can do with it)
* [Cambridge Launcher](https://github.com/Rexxt/cambridge-launcher) (working to put out a working version soon)
* [HUMILIATION](https://github.com/Rexxt/humiliation-discord) and [Hachi](https://github.com/Rexxt/hachi-discord) (former is a quirky bot engine, latter is a generalist-and-splatoon-oriented bot using it)
* [Blazenet](https://github.com/Rexxt/blazenet) (working to get a good adblock ready)
* [tifm](https://github.com/Rexxt/tifm) (thinking of features to add)
* [tifer](https://github.com/Rexxt/tifer) (working to add selection)

# Mizu
hello there

I'm a French tetris player, dev, designer and ***gamer***.
Preferred pronouns? He/him or They/them.
On my way to become a 20G Master!

Enough of that. Now, Github stuff.
Projects I maintain:
* [Cambridge](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge)
* [Tetra Legends Plus](https://github.com/Rexxt/tetralegendsplus)
